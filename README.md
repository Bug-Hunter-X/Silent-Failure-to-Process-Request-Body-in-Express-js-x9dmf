# Silent Failure to Process Request Body in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in an Express.js application where the request body is not processed when the Content-Type header is incorrect. The application silently fails without providing any error messages.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when the client sends a request with a Content-Type header that is not `application/json`. The `express.json()` middleware does not parse the body, leading to `req.body` being empty, causing the application to process without data leading to potential logic errors.  This often results in an empty data structure instead of an error, making debugging challenging.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `/data` with a Content-Type header other than `application/json`.  (e.g. using curl or Postman)
5. Observe that the server returns a 200 OK response, but the data is not processed. 

## Solution

The solution involves handling potential errors during the request body parsing, to enhance error handling and prevent unexpected behavior.
